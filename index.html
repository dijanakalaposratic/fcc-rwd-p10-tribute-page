                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 â€“ 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist 
                            best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

                        <li>
                            Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, 
                            gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.
                            In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York 
                            to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, 
                            licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase 
                            system which that company eventually marketed.

                            Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical 
                            oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging.  Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for 
                            wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in 
                            New York and Colorado Springs.

                            In the 1910s and 1920s Tesla experimented with a series of inventions with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, 
                            Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.
